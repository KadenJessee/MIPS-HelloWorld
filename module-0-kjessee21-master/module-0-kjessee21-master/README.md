# Module 0: MIPS Hello World Program
Welcome to CS2810 class. In this section of the class, you will learn how to read and write `assembly code`. The purpose of this assignment is to verify you have all the required tools to be successful in this class.

If you are reading this file, at least you already have your `github` account and either `git` or `github desktop` installed in your system. Next, try to open the [MARS IDE](bin/mars-4-5.jar) which is located in the `bin` folder. It is the file with the `.jar` extension. If you see the MARS gui, then congratulations on having Java properly installed in your system. Next, try to open the **ca/hello.asm** file. Build it and see if you get a "Hello CS 2810 World" message.
